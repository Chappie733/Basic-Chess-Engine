# Basic-Chess-Engine
A simple chess engine created with C++ as a personal project in about 25 days. The project is not 100% finished as there are still key features to be implemented
such as en passant and pawn promotion. 
The code is trash in some parts but this is literally the first C++ project I developed so go easy on it.
